      <p>This is my portfolio. I am a second year Computer Science and Engineer Major attending University of California, Merced.</p>
      <p>I was born and raised in Southern California. </p>
      <p>Some of my hobbies include playing tennis, going on hikes, and doodling. Recently I have enjoyed songwriting with my friends. </p>
      <p>I also enjoy traveling! I have had the pleasure of visiting Canada, Brazil, Korea, Japan, and Thailand. The country I visit most comfortably is probably Thailand because I speak the language and have family there. I also do a lot of traveling within the states!
